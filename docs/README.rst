Deploys or removes given certificates and keys.

Available modules
=================

.. contents::
    :local:

``cert_formula_helper.get_filenames_matching_content``
--------

A helper function to find certificate files that match certificate contents. Useful if a certificate file gets renamed to something you don't remember and have trouble finding a certificate you wish to remove.

Example
=======

Example that finds all certificate files in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates matching the certificate contents found in the pillar data in cert:certlist:cert.filename:cert

.. code-block::

    salt-call cert_formula_helper.get_filenames_matching_content /usr/local/share/ca-certificates  pillar_key="cert:certlist:cert.filename:cert"

Testing
=======

For integration testing, use kitchen

.. code-block::

    # Bundler is used to ensure correct library versions 
    bundle exec kitchen test
